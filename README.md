# Test Projects

This repository hosts miscellaneous experiments. The `snake.py` file is a
minimal terminal-based snake game implemented with `curses`.

## Running the Snake Game

The game requires Python 3 and a terminal that supports the `curses` module.
To start the game, run:

```bash
python3 snake.py
```

Use the arrow keys to control the snake. The game ends if the snake hits the
window boundaries or itself.
